## License

- Flutter Sound is copyrighted by Dooboolab (2018, 2019, 2020, 2021).
- Flutter Sound is released under the permissive Mozilla license which has a **weak** *copyleft* clause: if you modify some of Flutter Sound code you must publish your modifications under the MPL license too. But you may publish your App with any license you want. Even a Proprietary/Close Sources License (shame on you!).
