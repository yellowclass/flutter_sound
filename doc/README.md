![pub version](https://img.shields.io/pub/v/flutter_sound.svg?style=flat-square)

Flutter Sound is a set of libraries which deal with audio :

- A player for audio playback
- A recorder for recording audio
- Several utilities to handle audio files

![Demo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/27461460/77531555-77c9ec00-6ed6-11ea-9813-320f943b08cc.gif)

## Overview

Flutter Sound is a library package allowing you to play and record audio for :

* iOS
* Android
* Web

Flutter Sound provides both a high level API and widgets for:

* play audio
* record audio

Flutter Sound can be used to play a beep from an asset all the way up to implementing a complete media player.

The API is designed so you can use the supplied widgets or roll your own.

The Flutter Sound package supports playback from:

* Assets
* Files
* URL
* Streams

## SDK requirements

* Flutter Sound requires an iOS 10.0 SDK \(or later\)
* Flutter Sound requires an Android 21 \(or later\)

## Examples \(Demo Apps\)

Flutter Sound comes with several Demo/Examples :

[The `examples App`](https://github.com/dooboolab/flutter_sound/blob/master/flutter_sound/example/lib/main.dart) is a driver which can call all the various examples.

## Features

The Flutter Sound package includes the following features :

* Play and Record Ï„ or music with various codecs. \(See [the supported codecs here](guides_codec.html)\)
* Play local or remote files specified by their URL.
* Play assets.
* Record to a live stream Stream
* Playback from a live Stream
* The App playback can be controlled from the device lock screen or from an Apple watch
* Play audio using the built in \[SoundPlayerUI\] Widget.
* Roll your own UI utilizing the Ï„ api.
* Record audio using the builtin \[SoundRecorderUI\] Widget.
* Roll your own Recording UI utilizing the Ï„ api.
* Support for releasing/resuming resources when the app pauses/resumes.
* Record to a Dart Stream
* Playback from a Dart Stream
* The App playback can be controlled from the device lock screen or from an Apple watch

## Supported platforms

Flutter Sound is actually supported by the Flutter Framework.

If you are interested with other platforms (React Native, Cordova, JS, ...) maybe you can have a look to the GPL project [`Tau Sound Project 9.0`](https://tau.canardoux.xyz/readme.html) : we actually have several plans to port the Ï„ project to other frameworks.

## License

Flutter Sound 8.3 was published under the LGPL License.
A Flutter Sound developer noticed recently that this [license was incorrect](https://github.com/canardoux/tau/issues/696) :
the LGPL license does not allow static links to the library. The library must be linked dynamically.
The problem was that Flutter links-edit the plugins statically. This means that many Flutter Sound users who
use our library in private/close sources App was in a copyright infringement.

To solve this issue, we forked Flutter Sound 8.3 to two different branches.

* Flutter Sound 8.4 (this fork) is published under the Mozilla Public License 2.0.
* [The Ï„ Sound Project 9.0](https://pub.dev/packages/tau_sound) is published under a pure GPL License.

Flutter Sound is copyrighted by Dooboolab (2018, 2019, 2020, 2021).

* Flutter Sound is now released under the permissive Mozilla license which has a **weak** *copyleft* clause: if you modify some of Flutter Sound code you must publish your modifications under the MPL license too. But you may publish your App with any license you want. Even a Proprietary/Close Sources License (shame on you!).

## We need help

{% include important.html content="We greatly appreciate any contributions to the project which can be as simple as providing feedback on the API or documentation."%}

Actually, my main project is the GPL [Tau Sound Project 9.0](https://tau.canardoux.xyz/readme.html) and not anymore Flutter Sound. To be frank, I must say that there is no other main developers on Flutter Sound. This is bad, because Flutter Sound deserves to be maintained.
